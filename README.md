# Carbon-footprint-Estimation
# 🌍 Carbon Footprint Estimation and Reduction using AI

A final-year major project aimed at predicting and reducing industrial carbon emissions using a GRU-based deep learning model and synthetic industrial IoT datasets.

---

## 📘 Project Description

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence, specifically Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), to forecast the carbon footprint in industrial operations. The system simulates real-time data using synthetic generation techniques and suggests actionable strategies to optimize energy consumption and reduce emissions.
